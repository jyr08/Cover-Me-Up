## Lyrics
```
A heart on the run
 Keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure 
What I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room'
Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

I put your faith to the test 
When I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing"I thought it'd be me who helped him get home"
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along

So, girl, hang your dress out to dry
We ain't leaving this room'
Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on its stones
Like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room'
Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
```
