      <p>A heart on the run
        Keeps a hand on a gun
       Can't trust anyone </p>

        <p>
       I was so sure 
       What I needed was more
       Tried to shoot out the sun
        </p>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <p>
          The days when we raged, we flew off the page
          Such damage was done
        </p>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <p>
          But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
       I was meant for someone

        </p>
      </figure>

       

       
    
    
    <figure>
      <p>So, girl, leave your boots by the bed
        We ain't leaving this room'
        Til someone needs medical help
        Or the magnolias bloom
        It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
        So cover me up and know you're enough
        To use me for good</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p>I put your faith to the test 
        When I tore off your dress
        In Richmond on high
        I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
        Forever this time
        And the old lover's sing"I thought it'd be me who helped him get home"
        But home was a dream
        One that I'd never seen 'til you came along</p>      
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <p>So, girl, hang your dress out to dry
        We ain't leaving this room'
        Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
        And the river runs through
        And carries this house on its stones
        Like a piece of driftwood
        So, cover me up and know you're enough
        To use me for good </p>

    </figure>
