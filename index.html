      <p> A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun <br>
        Can't trust anyone <br>
        I was so sure what I needed was more <br>
        Tried to shoot out the sun <br>
        The days when we raged, we flew off the page <br>
        Such damage was done <br>
        But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew <br>
        I was meant for someone</p>
      
      
        <p>So, girl, leave your boots by the bed <br>
        We ain't leaving this room' <br>
        Til someone needs medical help <br>
        Or the magnolias bloom <br>
        It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood <br>
        So cover me up and know you're enough <br>
        To use me for good</p>
        
        <p>I put your faith to the test <br>
        When I tore off your dress <br>
        In Richmond on high <br>
        I sobered up, I swore off that stuff <br>
        Forever this time <br>
        And the old lover's sing <br>
        "I thought it'd be me who helped him get home" <br>
        But home was a dream <br>
        One that I'd never seen 'til you came along <br>
     
        <p> So, girl, hang your dress out to dry <br>
          We ain't leaving this room' <br>
          Til Percy Priest breaks open wide <br>
          And the river runs through <br>
          And carries this house on its stones like a piece of driftwood <br>
          So, cover me up and know you're enough <br>
          To use me for good </p>
        
        <p>So, girl, leave your boots by the bed <br>
          We ain't leaving this room' <br>
          Til someone needs medical help <br>
          Or the magnolias bloom <br>
          It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood <br>
          So cover me up and know you're enough <br>
          To use me for good <br>
